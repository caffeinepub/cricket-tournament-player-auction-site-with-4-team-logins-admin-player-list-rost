# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Publish Draft Version 15 as the live/production deployment with no additional changes.

**Planned changes:**
- Promote/deploy the existing Draft Version 15 build to the live/production environment without introducing new commits, code changes, or asset changes.
- Validate the live deployment loads successfully and supports navigation to the existing routes: `/` (login), `/team`, and `/admin`.
- Ensure the existing leading-team/leading-bid highlight animation remains present in the live deployment.

**User-visible outcome:** Users access the production site running the exact Draft Version 15 experience, including working navigation to `/`, `/team`, and `/admin`, and the existing leading-team/bid highlight animation.
