  "summary": "Routing was updated to use TanStack Router with browser history and to redirect unknown routes to '/' without showing a NotFound UI. However, the diff does not show any production hosting/rewrites configuration changes required for deep links/refresh to work when the server would otherwise return a 404 for non-root paths.",

      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Deep links and refreshes on valid internal routes must work in production (server/hosting must serve index.html for SPA routes).",
      "reason": "The router is switched to browser-history navigation, but there is no evidence of changes to the production hosting rewrite/fallback configuration (e.g., IC asset config) that would ensure requests to /team, /admin, /s/<shareId>, /debug return the SPA entry document instead of a server 404. DEPLOYMENT.md mentions this requirement but no such config file changes are shown in the diff summary.",
