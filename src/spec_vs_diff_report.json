  "summary": "REQ-1 required publishing Draft Version 15 to production without introducing additional code/asset changes. The diff shows multiple code and documentation changes (including backend logic changes and a new deployment guide), which contradicts the constraint/AC that production should run the exact same code/assets as Draft Version 15.",

    {
      "id": "REQ-1",
      "requirement": "Publish the current Draft Version 15 build as the live/production deployment without introducing any additional feature changes beyond what is already in Draft Version 15.",
      "reason": "The acceptance criteria requires no additional commits/changes introduced solely for publishing, but the diff includes new and modified files (backend code changes and new docs/state files). A pure publish/release step is not reflected; instead, source changes are present.",

      "description": "Added a detailed frontend deployment guide and expanded smoke test checklist (including many UI/feature verifications unrelated to a pure publish step).",
      "reason": "BuildRequest explicitly constrained the work to only the publish/release step with no new product features or UI/UX changes; adding new documentation/process content is a change not requested by REQ-1.",

    {
      "description": "Backend authorization and state/logic changes (e.g., use of AccessControl/MixinAuthorization, profile query authorization checks, and other backend code modifications).",
      "reason": "Non-goals include backend schema/state migrations or resets, and the requirement was to publish the existing build without additional feature changes; modifying backend code goes beyond a pure deployment step.",

      "reason": "The request forbids new product features or UI/UX changes and asked only to publish Draft Version 15 as-is; the modified summary text indicates additional/changed UI behaviors and features.",
